BlackJack project

 Blackjack, also known as twenty-one, is a comparing card game between usually several players and a dealer, where each player in turn competes against the dealer. It is the most widely played casino banking game in the world. The objective of the game is to beat the dealer in one of the following ways:

Get 21 points on the player's first two cards (called a "blackjack"), without a dealer blackjack;

Reach a final score higher than the dealer without exceeding 21; or

Let the dealer draw additional cards until their hand exceeds 21.

Players are each dealt two cards face up. The dealer is also dealt two cards, normally one up and one down. The cards two through ten have face value, face cards have a value of 10 and aces are valued at one or eleven. Your hand's value is the sum of the two cards dealt. Each player will have a chance to "hit" (draw more cards) or "stand" ( stay where you are). Once all players are satisfied with the value of their hands the dealer then flips his cards over to reveal his value. The dealer is required to "hit" until his value equals 17 or more, unless his value already beats out the players. The goal of the player(s) is to beat out the dealer by not "busting" (going over 21).
